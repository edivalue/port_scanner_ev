# Port Scanner

A simple Python script that scans for open ports on a specified host. The script is multi-threaded to speed up the scan process. It is a tool used by system administrators and security analysts to identify potential vulnerabilities in a network.

# Usage

Run the script using python3 scanner.py <hostname or IP address> or simply ./scanner.py <hostname or IP address> if executable permission is set
The script will scan for open ports between port 1 and port 8000 and output the results on the console
